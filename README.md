### Hi there 👋

😄 23 years old, I'm from China and I'm a Microsoft fan.

🔭 Independent C# developer.

🌱 Like to share blogs, video tutorials, source code

💬 Hope to continue to share in the domestic WPF, Xamarin and other technologies, the establishment of the domestic C# ecological community, so that WPF, Xamarin in China has more market applications.
